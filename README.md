# Prediction-of-Loss-Ratio
Given a training data set containing a set of auto policies including a number of policy level attributes as well as Annual Premium and Loss Amount and a testing data set of 330 policy portfolios, each having at least 1,000 auto policies, the goal of this project is to predict the natural logarithm of the loss ratio of a portfolio of auto insurance policies.
